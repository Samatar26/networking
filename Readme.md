# Networking

We'll be covering the following topics:
- Introduction to networking
- Network communication protocols
 - TCP/IP protocol, DHCP and DNS
- Network Topology
 - Star, Ring, Tree, Fully connected, etc.
- Network Types
 - Personal Area Network (PAN), Local Area Network (LAN), Campus Area Network (CAN), etc.

### What is networking?

Two or more `nodes` (e.g. computers) connected together by some means of communication so as to share or distribute resources.

Connection can be achieved by cables, radio signals, telephone lines, signals over power lines, optical signals, satellite communications, etc.

This concept extends from small local clusters of computers to the internet.

#####Â Method of communication - TCP/IP

To function as a network, nodes need to utilise a common method of communication. The de facto standard specification for communication is `TCP/IP` (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).

TCP/IP is maintained by a global standards body called the `Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)`. It's a large open international community of network designers, operators, vendors and researchers concerned with the evolution of the internet architecture and the smooth operation of the internet. It's open to any interested individual.

#### The protocol stack

This is generally referred to as the four-layer model, although there are six components to it in this case.

The protocol stack provides layers of abstractions to the communication process so that a logical communication can be considered between nodes at each layer. Think in terms of a postal or courier service as an analogy. Standards define the protocol stack itself (RFC1122) and various protocols within the stack.
